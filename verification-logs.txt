--- Starting Causal Consistency Test Scenario ---

--- Step 1: Write 'value_A' to Node1 (Event A) ---
Client: PUT 'causal_key':'value_A' to node1

--- Step 2: Read 'causal_key' from Node2 (Event B, depends on A) ---
Client: GET 'causal_key' from node2
Client: Error GET from node2: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8002): Read timed out. (read timeout=5)

--- Step 3: Write 'value_C' to Node3 (Event C, depends on B) ---
Client: PUT 'causal_key':'value_C' to node3
Client: Error PUT to node3: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8003): Read timed out. (read timeout=5)

--- Waiting for replication and buffer processing (5 seconds) ---

--- Final Status Verification ---
Client: GET 'causal_key' from node1
Client: node1 -> 'causal_key': 'value_A', VC: {'node1': 2, 'node2': 0, 'node3': 0}
Client: GET 'causal_key' from node2
Client: Error GET from node2: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8002): Read timed out. (read timeout=5)
Client: GET 'causal_key' from node3
Client: Error GET from node3: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8003): Read timed out. (read timeout=5)
